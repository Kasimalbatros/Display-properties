1.Display: inline;    --> this makes all element should come in one line.
          but drawback is Width and Height property not work in this.

2.Display: inline-block;  -->this works same as inline but in this you can access
	Width,height proprty .

Note:- Difference between Display: inline;  and  Display: inline-block; is that
inline-block; allows to set width and height on the element.


3.Display: none;  -->no block is diplayed on screen.(Hide element without deleting.)

4.Display: block;  -->displays an element as block.

Note:- Difference between Display: block;  and  Display: inline-block; is that
inline-block; does not add a line-break after the element, so the element
can sit next to other element.
